        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>I first become interested in computer science whenever I took a class with a math professor who also taught
            computer science. After taking this class I decidede that I wanted to take some coding classes to see if I 
            liked it as much as it seemed. I did enjoy these classes but I decided to finish my economics degree and 
            start a bootcamp post graduation.
        </p>
        <p>I am very excited to begin the Thinkful bootcamp, I'm ready to meet my cohort and begin the life changing journey
            to becoming a professional software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>Outside of coding I am an avid reader, a big soccer fan and a music lover. Some of my favorite musical artists are 
            Run River North and Arlo Parks. My favorite soccer team is Chelsea FC.
